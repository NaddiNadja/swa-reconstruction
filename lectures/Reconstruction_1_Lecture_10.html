#### Software Architecture Course

###  Session #10

# Architecture Reconstruction 


Assoc. Prof. Mircea Lungu

---



# Meta

This and following three lectures
 - Are material that you don't find in the textbook (*there will still be readings*)
 - Is going to give you the chance to do a bit of coding for program analysis
 - Have inspired several of your colleagues to choose thesis projects
 
 
Feedback
- [Anonymous feedback form](https://forms.gle/ADWfDZdKfPwdFG1D6)
- Email: mlun@itu.dk
- PR on the  [.md version of the slides on GH](https://github.com/mircealungu/itu-architecture-reconstruction/blob/master/lectures/Reconstruction_1_Lecture_10.md) if you see bugs

---

# Imagine ... 

- Onboarding on a new system
- Buying a large company
- Risk assessment for security
- Architectural evaluation

What do these have in common?

---

# Even paying 50B for a company does not guarantee architectural diagrams

# Discussion

Have you seen architectural documentation for every system?

- No, *Why is it missing?* 
- Yes? 
	- Is it up to date? 
	- *No? Why not?* 
 
---

## Why is Architectural Documentation Obsolete?

 - it's hard to maintain

 - link (traceability ) between architecture and code is often not obvious

 - no perceived value for the customer

 - because developers make decisions and changes 
	 - that are not aligned with the original vision => **[architectural drift](https://youtu.be/hExflmcBSc4?t=14)**
	 - that go against prescriptive architecture => **[architectural erosion](https://youtu.be/hExflmcBSc4?t=70)**


---


# Architecture Erosion Example

E.g. architectural anti-pattern

What could be the problem here?

---

# How to Keep Architectural Documentation up to Date?

1 / **Enforcing architectural constraints** 
- special DSLs and tools for architecture constraints definition (e.g. [Dictō](https://scg.unibe.ch/archive/papers/Cara14b-Dicto.pdf))
- some are implemented as Unit Tests  (e.g. [ArchUnit](https://www.archunit.org/use-cases))

--

2 / **Generating architectural diagrams from code**
- as opposed to drawing them in Powerpoint
- we'll see techniques for doing this
- interesting research direction & thesis topic

--

3 / **Reconstructing the Architecture**
- and ideally follow up with one of the previous two

# Architecture Reconstruction (AR)


a.k.a: *architecture recovery* (the two are used interchangeably)

**Def.**  A reverse engineering approach that aims at reconstructing viable architectural views of
a software application [1]

- reverse engineering?



 [1] Ducasse & Pollet, [Software Architecture Reconstruction:
a Process-Oriented Taxonomy](https://rmod.inria.fr/archives/papers/Duca09c-TSE-SOAArchitectureExtraction.pdf)

---

# Reverse Engineering

**Def.** the process of analyzing a subject system to identify the system’s components and their interrela- tionships and create representations of the system in another form or at a higher level of abstraction. (Demeyer et al., [Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/OORP.pdf), Chapter 1.2)

Key takeaways: 
- idenitfy
	- components 
	- relationships
- higher level of abstraction

Relation with architecture recovery?

# Reengineering

<img src='images/reengineering_process.png' style='width:70%; float:right;'/>



“ ... is the **examination and alteration** of a subject system to reconstitute it in a new form” (Demeyer et al., [Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/OORP.pdf), Chapter 1.2)


Relation with AR? 

???

AR could be a possible first step in reengineering

# A Process for Reconstruction: Symphony

[Symphony: View-Driven Software Architecture Reconstruction](https://ipa.win.tue.nl/archive/springdays2005/Deursen1.pdf)

- Paper by Van Deursen et al.
- Distinguishes between three kinds of *views*
    1. **Source** 
	     - view extracted directly from artifacts of a system
	     - not necessarily architectural (e.g. see later example)
    2. **Target**  
	     - describes architecture-as-implemented
	     - any of the 3+1 views
    3. **Hypothetical** 
	     - architecture-as-designed
	     - existing documentation
	     - presentations

---

## Symphony Stages: Design (blue) & Execution (yellow)

<img src='images/symphony.png' style="width:600px;"/>

---

## Symphony: Design

Problem elicitation
- “Business case” for reconstruction
- What is the problem? 

Concept determination
- What architectural information is needed to solve the problem?
- Which viewpoints are relevant?

---

## Symphony: Execution

Data gathering
 - collecting and extracting low-level source views
 - can involve a multitude of sources
 
 
Knowledge inference
 - going from source to target views
 - abstracting low-level information
 
 
Information interpretation 
 - analysis, creating new documentation

# Data Gathering



Example: [Google Collab with Basic Data Gathering](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oe_TV7936Zmmzbbgq8rzqFpxYPX7SQHP#scrollTo=0ruTtX88Tb-w)

---
# Individual Assignment


### Goal is to
- recover the architecture of an existing system

- document the outcome in an **individual report**
	- brief (not more than 3 -- 5 pages)
	- do not explain to us what Symphony does in the report
	- focus on your results


---

# Individual Assignment (contd.)


### Case-Study Systems

1. The Zeeguu Project - **default**
	- [Online Deployment](https://zeeguu.com) (invite code: zeeguu-beta)
	- Code:
		- Python Backend: [Zeeguu-API](https://github.com/zeeguu/API)
		- React Frontend: [Zeeguu-Web](https://github.com/zeeguu/web) 
	- A [paper](https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/CHI18-Paper/blob/master/!AsWeMayStudy--Preprint.pdf) about the system

2. Another system that you know
	- if it has comparable complexity (>200 files)
	- you confirm with me about the appropriateness of the system

---
# Individual Assignment (contd.)


### Viewpoints to Recover

1. Module Viewpoint
	- we will write example code snippets in collab to support this
	- makes the most sense for the Zeeguu system

1. Other Viewpoints
	- some of your colleagues looked at the docker-compose.yml to figure out deployment
	- might make more sense for another system - the Zeeguu one is too simple (could be done together with the module)

---


# Individual Assignment (contd.)

### Tools 
- are important for recovery

- **if you can program**, then this is your chance to be coding **analysis tools** over the upcoming lectures
  - you can still code as a team! (you only have to write the analysis on your own)

- **if you can't program**, then you'll have to find third party tools (the time the programming ones spend on programming, you'll be spending on finding third party tools)

# For Next Week

  
### Reading
- [Symphony: View-Driven Software Architecture Reconstruction](https://ipa.win.tue.nl/archive/springdays2005/Deursen1.pdf)

- [Demeyer et al., Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/OORP.pdf)
	- Chapter 1.2 - Reengineering and Reverse Engineering
	
  
### Practice
- [Basic Data Gathering](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oe_TV7936Zmmzbbgq8rzqFpxYPX7SQHP#scrollTo=0ruTtX88Tb-w)
	- Can you think about techniques for "abstracting" this information? 
	- Think about: are there any dependencies that we're not extracting?
