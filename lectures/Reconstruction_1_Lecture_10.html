###  Session #10

# Architecture Reconstruction 


Assoc. Prof. Mircea Lungu

# Meta

This and following three lectures
 - Are material that you don't find in the textbook
 - Influenced by past student feedback
 - Have inspired several of your colleagues to choose thesis projects
 
 
Feedback
- Anonymous form: https://forms.gle/ADWfDZdKfPwdFG1D6
- Email: mlun@itu.dk
- PR on the GitHub version of the slides if you see bugs

---

# Imagine ... 

- Onboarding on a new system
- Buying a large company
- Risk assessment for security
- Architectural evaluation

What do these have in common?

# Even paying 50B for a company does not guarantee architectural diagrams

# Discussion

Have you seen architectural documentation for every system?

- No, *Why is it missing?* 
- Yes? 
	- Is it up to date? 
	- *No? Why not?* 
 
---

## Why is Architectural Documentation Obsolete?

--

 - it's hard to maintain
 - link (traceability ) between architecture and code is often not obvious
 - no perceived value for the customer
 - because developers 
	 - make changes that are not aligned (**architectural drift**)
	 - make decisions that don't respect earlier decisions (**architectural erosion**)


   - possible solution: enforcing architectural constraints 
     - special DSL for architecture constraints definition
     - implemented as Unit Tests

# What Happens When Developers Are Not Aware of Architecture?

e.g. possible scenario of dev not being aware of architecture => architectural anti-pattern.

# Architecture Reconstruction (AR)


A reverse engineering approach that aims at reconstructing viable architectural views of
a software application [1]

- an approach = an activity
- reconstructing? why?
- reverse engineering?

a.k.a: *architecture recovery*

 *[[1] Ducasse & Pollet, Software Architecture Reconstruction:
a Process-Oriented Taxonomy](https://rmod.inria.fr/archives/papers/Duca09c-TSE-SOAArchitectureExtraction.pdf)*

# Reverse Engineering

From, Demeyer et al., [Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/OORP.pdf), Chapter 1.2:

“**Reverse Engineering** is the process of analyzing a subject system to identify the system’s components and their interrela- tionships and create representations of the system in another form or at a higher level of abstraction.”

Key takeaways: 
- identify components & relationships
- higher level of abstraction

Relation with architecture recovery:
- similar activities

---

# Reengineering

<img src='images/reengineering_process.png' style='width:70%; float:right;'/>



“ ... is the **examination and alteration** of a subject system to reconstitute it in a new form”


Relation with architecture recovery:
- AR could be a possible first step in reengineering

From, Demeyer et al., [Object Oriented Reengineering Patterns](http://scg.unibe.ch/download/oorp/OORP.pdf), Chapter 1.2:

# A Process for Reconstruction: Symphony

- [Symphony: View-Driven Software Architecture Reconstruction](./papers/deursen-symphony.pdf)

- Recovers views and viewpoints as in IEE 1471 / 3+1
- Distinguishes between three kinds of views:
    1. Source 
     - view extracted from artifacts of a sytem
     - not necessarily architectural (e.g. AST)
    1. Target  
     - describes architecture-as-implemented
     - any of the 3+1 views
    1. Hypothetical 
     - architecture-as-designed
     - existing documentation
     - presentations

---

## Symphony Stages: Design (blue) & Execution (yellow)

<img src='images/symphony.png' style="width:600px;"/>

---

## Symphony: Design

Problem elicitation
- “Business case” for reconstruction
- What is the problem? 

Concept determination
- What architectural information is needed to solve the problem?
- Which viewpoints are relevant?

---

## Symphony: Execution

Data gathering
 - collecting and extracting low-level source views
 - can involve a multitude of sources
 
 
Knowledge inference
 - going from source to target views
 - abstracting low-level information
 
 
Information interpretation 
 - analysis, creating new documentation

# Individual Assignment


Goal is to 
- recover the architecture of an existing system
- document the process and the outcome in an individual report

Reports are: 
 - due in Week TBD
 - submittable one week before for feedback

Tools 
- are important for recovery
- **if you can program**, then this is your chance to be coding **analysis tools** over the upcoming lectures
  - you can still code as a team! (you only have to write the analysis on your own)
- **if you can't program**, then you'll have to find third party tools (the time the programming ones spend on programming, you'll be spending on finding third party tools)

# Individual Assignment (contd.)


### Case-Study Systems

- The [Zeeguu Project](https://zeeguu.com): 
  - [Zeeguu-API](https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/Zeeguu-API)
  - [Zeeguu-React](https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/zeeguu-react) 
  - invite code: zeeguu-beta
  - a [paper](https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/CHI18-Paper/blob/master/!AsWeMayStudy--Preprint.pdf) about the system
- You can analyze another system of a comparable complexity
  - confirm with me or the TAs about the appropriateness of the system

# For Next Week

  
  
- (Watch the [live coding session of last year](https://app.vidgrid.com/view/qs3vPcPnjnKT?autoplay=1&t=3751.587316)), try to replicate it, [submit questions about it](https://forms.gle/bsxyKVNfm2LdHaMm7)


- Read 
  - (today's) [Symphony paper](https://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/st/papers/symphony-wicsa04.pdf) and if something is not clear [write questions about it](https://forms.gle/bsxyKVNfm2LdHaMm7)
  - (next time) [What Architects Should Know About Reverse Engineering and Rengineering](https://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/st/papers/keynote-wicsa05.pdf)
  - (next time) [Reflexion Models paper](http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/cs63902/Papers/Murphy95.pdf)
